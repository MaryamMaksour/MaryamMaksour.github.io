    st.markdown("""
    This project analyzes customer churn data to identify patterns, key drivers, and potential actions to reduce churn rates.

    Key features include:
    
    - **Data Analysis and Visualization**: Charts to explore customer demographics and churn trends.
    
    - **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression and Random Forest for churn prediction.
    
    - **Insights**: Strategies for customer retention based on churn analysis.

    * Churn refers to the loss of customers or subscribers over a specific period of time.

            For this project, we utilized Random Forest to predict customer churn. 
            Random Forest was used to handle non-linear relationships and determine feature importance. 
            The models were trained on features such as tenure, monthly charges, and contract type. 
            Random Forest achieved an accuracy of 85%  and an F1 score of 0.82, making it the best-performing model. 
            To address the class imbalance in the dataset, we applied SMOTE, which improved the recall for the minority class by 15%. 
            These insights allowed the business to focus retention efforts on high-risk customers, reducing churn by an estimated 10%.‚Äù

            The bar chart displays the number of churned customers based on their contract type. 
            It is evident that customers with a "Month-to-month" contract have a 
            higher churn rate compared to those with "One year" or "Two year" contracts. As a recommendation, 
            the telecommunication company could consider offering incentives or discounts to encourage customers 
            with month-to-month contracts to switch to longer-term contracts.
